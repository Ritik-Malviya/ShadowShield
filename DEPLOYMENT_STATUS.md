# ShadowShield Deployment Status

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend API URL: https://shadowshield-backend.onrender.com
- ✅ Frontend URL: https://frontend-ritiks-projects-9f564ec3.vercel.app

## Configuration
- ✅ Frontend API service is configured to use the production backend URL
- ✅ Backend CORS is configured to allow the frontend domain
- ✅ Environment variables are set correctly
- ✅ API routes have proper `/api` prefix 

## Testing Tools
- ✅ Direct Login Test: /direct-login-test.html
- ✅ API Tester: /api-tester.html
- ✅ CORS Test: /cors-test.html
- ✅ Node.js connection test script

## Connection Testing Results
- ✅ Backend health endpoint is responding correctly
- ✅ Login and register endpoints are reachable
- ✅ CORS is properly configured

## Next Steps
1. **Verify with Users**: Ask users to test the application on different devices and browsers to ensure there are no issues.
2. **Monitor Error Logs**: Check error logs on both the frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) regularly.
3. **Consider Adding Analytics**: Implement basic analytics to track API request success rates.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Once basic functionality is confirmed, consider optimizing API response times.

## Potential Issues to Watch For
1. **Cold Start Delays**: Render's free tier has cold start delays. The first request after inactivity may take longer.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Watch for potential rate limiting on the free tiers of the hosting services.
3. **Connection Timeouts**: Some networks may have strict timeout policies. Consider adjusting the axios timeout if needed.
