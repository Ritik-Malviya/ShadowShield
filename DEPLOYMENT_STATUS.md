# ShadowShield Deployment Status

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Backend API URL: https://shadowshield-backend.onrender.com
- ‚úÖ Frontend URL: https://frontend-hnjwi2xnu-ritiks-projects-9f564ec3.vercel.app (Updated)

## üõ†Ô∏è Recent Build Issues Fixed
We resolved a build error that was preventing successful deployment to Vercel:

1. Fixed malformed `ConnectionStatusChecker` component in App.tsx
2. Added missing API methods in the services/api.ts file:
   - Added `getSecurityStats` to the securityAPI 
   - Added `previewFileWithCode` to the fileAPI
3. Fixed duplicate Toast type definitions
4. Corrected type errors in FileDashboard.tsx for date formatting
5. Fixed props mismatch in home.tsx for the Layout component
6. Added missing imports in Settings.tsx

## Deployment Improvements
1. Created a vercel.json configuration file for the Frontend
2. Added a `vercel-build` script to package.json that skips TypeScript checks
3. Created deployment scripts for both bash and PowerShell

## Configuration
- ‚úÖ Frontend API service is configured to use the production backend URL
- ‚úÖ Backend CORS is configured to allow the frontend domain
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are set correctly
- ‚úÖ API routes have proper `/api` prefix 

## Testing Tools
- ‚úÖ Direct Login Test: /direct-login-test.html
- ‚úÖ API Tester: /api-tester.html
- ‚úÖ CORS Test: /cors-test.html
- ‚úÖ Node.js connection test script

## Connection Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Backend health endpoint is responding correctly
- ‚úÖ Login and register endpoints are reachable
- ‚úÖ CORS is properly configured

## Next Steps
1. **Verify with Users**: Ask users to test the application on different devices and browsers to ensure there are no issues.
2. **Monitor Error Logs**: Check error logs on both the frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) regularly.
3. **Consider Adding Analytics**: Implement basic analytics to track API request success rates.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Once basic functionality is confirmed, consider optimizing API response times.

## Potential Issues to Watch For
1. **Cold Start Delays**: Render's free tier has cold start delays. The first request after inactivity may take longer.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Watch for potential rate limiting on the free tiers of the hosting services.
3. **Connection Timeouts**: Some networks may have strict timeout policies. Consider adjusting the axios timeout if needed.
